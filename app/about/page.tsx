              Why PlutoFlow
            </h2>
            <p className='text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg'>
              Most data professionals are not good at software development or
              engineering, so PlutoFlow was created to be an easy, possibly a
              no-code platform that can help data professionals and companies
              test and scale their ML models in production. We are working hard
              to be simple and also help you create APIs with an upload of a
              model.

                I am Fosberg, and I built this. I am into software engineering,
                machine learning engineering, and AI engineering. I am also a
                recent college graduate from KNUST Ghana. This should have
                existed, and I am now building it. Currently, it is maintained
                by me and my college classmate Yakubuku Seidu, a professional
                software engineer.

                Yes your model is safe. It is stored in Azure Blob storage account. Sincerely it is not reviewed for anything. We are building
                a community to help scientists and developers and we respect thier contributions to open and close ML/AI.
